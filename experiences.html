                            <h5>Establishment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Center of Excellence (CoE) and Development of RPA Solutions<span> - North Lanarkshire Council (NLC)</span></h5>
                            <p>
                                This project involved setting up an AI and RPA Center of Excellence (CoE) within the North Lanarkshire Council (NLC). The aim was to improve the council's operational efficiency by implementing AI and RPA solutions across various departments. <br /><br />

                                To establish the CoE, I worked with stakeholders to define its objectives, governance structure, and operational model. I also created a roadmap outlining its strategic direction, key milestones, and success criteria. This included conducting workshops with the council to collaborate closely and identify the best operational practices for the CoE. <br /><br />

                                Furthermore, we conducted bootcamps for the council on Power Automate, Power Pages, Copilot Studio, and UiPath to upskill employees in RPA and AI technologies, aiming for them to become citizen developers. <br /><br />

                                After the CoE was established, the team was tasked with creating four chatbot Proof of Concepts (POCs): one for citizens to report household waste issues, another for answering council tax FAQs, a triage system to direct citizens to the appropriate resources, and a platform for citizens to submit complaints. My primary responsibility for these chatbots was integrating SAML authentication with the Copilot chatbots and API integration with the "Submission Framework," a council-specific system for submitting cases. Additionally, I provided training to council staff on how to use and maintain the chatbots, and offered advisory services on which processes were best suited for automation (using Power Automate), including their design and implementation. <br /><br />

                            <p>

                                During my placement, I was part of a team developing a section of the CCA (Cloud Cost Assurance) tool. This tool assists clients in managing their cloud expenses by providing a dashboard that shows current costs and potential savings from changes in architecture or using different providers. It offers tailored recommendations prioritised by feasibility. <br /><br />

                                The CCA tool consists of modular "Jobs" that cater to specific client needs, including cost and carbon footprint analyses. My team focused on developing the cost analysis job for AWS compute services. We utilised AWS CloudWatch APIs to analyse client usage data, estimate resource requirements, alternative prices, and migration costs. <br /><br />
                                
                                We used Java and Gradle to develop the project, emphasising a Functional Programming approach for efficiency and scalability.
