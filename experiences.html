                            <p>
                                As part of of my degree programme (see education page), over the four years I am at Queens 
                                I will take part in four summer placements and a year placement with PwC. This programme has 
                                allowed me to sharpen both my technical and business skills while gaining invaluable experiences
                                and expanding my knowledge of all the different technological platforms available. <br /><br />

                                During my time at PwC I primarly worked within private cloud transformation, data and analytics, and RPA development 
                                where I was able to work with clients solve varying issues.  
                                Below is some information about the different pojects that I worked on at PwC.

                                    I worked on a team creating a TDW (Tech Delivery Workbench) for a client. A TDW is a 
                                    tool for managing agile software development, it links different servers like Jira, 
                                    Azure DevOps, Slack, GitHub, Jenkins, Microsoft Project and many more together to 
                                    create a PowerBI dashboard which allows project managers to monitor development progress 
                                    in a simple and easy to read way.

                                <h5>Process Mining and RPA Development<span> - PwC</span></h5>
                                <p>
                                    During my second placement at PwC I worked within a team where we used process mining 
                                    and RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to automate varying financial tasks within the 
                                    clients business. <br /><br />

                                    Process mining is where you use event logs to create dashboards and process flows to 
                                    identify inefficiencies within the project by talking to process owners and analyzing 
                                    the data allowing you to see where the bottlenecks are and what the “happy path” may be. 
                                    This will identify areas where automation can be used to improve efficiency and minimize 
                                    deviation from the “happy path”. <br /><br />

                                    While on this project we primarily used UiPath for the process mining and RPA development 
                                    to identify and improve inefficacies within the P2P (Purchase to Pay), O2C (Order to Cash) 
                                    and R2R (Record to Report) processes.

                        <h5>Software Engineer (Work Experience Programme)<span> - PSNI</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            I was part of the Sentinus IT Bursary Scheme which connected me to the PSNI to work on some projects 
                            during the end of the summer while I was doing my A-Levels. <br /><br />

                            One of these projects was a prototype facial recognition system, which was programmed in python. It 
                            would take 2 images as input and would identify landmarks on each of the faces of the people (or person) 
                            in the image and give a confidence score on how likely that the person from image 1 is the same as any 
                            persons in image 2. It also added bounding boxes around all faces in the images so the user can tell which 
                            person the algorithm thinks is the most likely to be a match to the person in image 1.<br /><br />

                            I also worked on helping the PSNI set up a secure cloud storage system called box and created a program 
                            that allows the user to interact with spreadsheets on box, the program allowed the user to upload single 
                            records or upload records as a batch file, delete multiple records and edit these records as well.<br /><br />

                            In my final week of the placement I wrote a report comparing some of the most popular hand writing recognition 
                            software’s that were available on the market at the time to see which would be the best for the PSNI to digitise 
                            some of the older hand written case notes.<br /><br />

                            During this placement and the creation of these systems I had to work with a group of people on the PSNI and 
                            contact people at box, this helped me develop team working skills and improved my communication abilities. 
                            This experience took place over four weeks.

                        <p>
                            At Catalyst I was a part of the Generation Innovation Re imagining Work Experience Program which took place over 
                            four days. Here I worked in a team with six other students, one facilitator from Catalyst and a representative of 
                            the company my team was paired with (Allstate). <br /><br />

                            In this team we worked together to form a product to solve a problem Allstate gave us, this problem was 
                            “how do we make transport smarter, safer and more useful for everyone in Belfast?”. <br /><br />

                            For the first three days we went through all the different stages of designing a product and on the fourth day we 
                            traveled to the company and presented our finished product to twenty of the senior staff. After this we had a three 
                            minute pitch of our idea to over 250 people, some of which including staff from different companies and universities 
                            like Queens and Ulster. We had to chose two people to give this pitch and I was one of them.

                            During this time I worked within a team of two other students, where we investigated the outcomes of various 
                            scientific experiment using virtual laboratories to see how close they matched to the real world equivalent.
                            Once we completed the experiments we then completed a write up summarising our findings.

                            We done this by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
