                            <p>
                                As a part of my degree program (please refer to the Education section), I will undergo a series of placements over the 
                                course of four years at Queen's University. These experiences include three 15-week summer placements and two separate 6-month placementsâ€”one 
                                during Semester 1 of Year 3 and the other in Semester 2 of Year 4. This cumulative commitment accounts for nearly 1 year and 11 months of 
                                hands-on placement experience.

                                <br /><br />

                                This comprehensive program has been instrumental in honing not only my technical competencies but also my business acumen. It has provided me 
                                with invaluable opportunities to broaden my knowledge across various technological platforms.

                                <br /><br />

                                During my tenure at PwC, my primary areas of focus encompassed private cloud transformation, data and analytics, and the development of Robotic 
                                Process Automation (RPA) solutions. Within these domains, I collaborated with clients to address diverse challenges. Below, I outline some of the 
                                notable projects I had the privilege of working on during my time at PwC.

                                <h5>CCA (Cloud Cost Assurance)<span> - PwC</span></h5>
                                <p>
                                    This placement I was working on a team that was responsible for developing a section of the CCA (Cloud Cost Assurance) tool.
                                    This tool was designed to assist clients in effectively managing their cloud-related expenses. It achieved this by providing 
                                    clients with an all-encompassing dashboard, which not only showcased their current cloud infrastructure costs but also 
                                    projected potential savings achievable by transitioning to different architectures or even alternative cloud service providers. 
                                    The tool also offered clients tailored recommendations on how to limit their cloud expenditures, prioritizing these 
                                    recommendations based on their feasibility for the client.

                                    <br /><br />

                                    The CCA tool is modular, consisting of various "Jobs" that can be executed to cater to the specific needs of clients. These jobs encompass a range of tasks, including cost analysis of particular cloud services from specific providers and conducting carbon footprint analyses for these services.

                                    <br /><br />
                                    
                                    The team I was working on was responsible for developing the cost analysis job for AWS compute services. This involved
                                    analysis of the clients current compute services which was done by using the various APIs available from AWS Cloud Watch 
                                    which allowed us to gain the clients usage data. This data was then processed and analysed to determine what resources
                                    the client needs from their compute serivce then estimate the prices of alternatives, then estimate associated migration
                                    costs based on how different the cheapest service is from the clients current service.

                                    <br /><br />

                                    The development of this project was carried out using Java, with Gradle serving as the primary build tool. Emphasizing a Functional Programming approach, the project prioritized code efficiency and scalability, given the extensive datasets it dealt with. 
                                    Additionally, the project adhered to a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, promoting clearer code and an expedited development 
                                    process.

                                    <br /><br />

                                    Furthermore, I was entrusted with leadership responsibilities by the Director overseeing the CCA project. I had the opportunity to 
                                    manage Year 1 and Year 2 Technology Degree Apprentices (TDA) and served as a mentor to them. During this period, I conducted workshops 
                                    to elucidate the usage of Azure DevOps, including ticket management and branching strategies, as well as the principles of Test-Driven 
                                    Development and JUnit testing. This experience allowed me to further enhance my leadership and mentoring skills while contributing to the 
                                    professional development of my colleagues.

                                <p>
                                    I had the opportunity to contribute to a Google Workspace add-on project known as "Data Lab Importer." 
                                    This valuable asset empowered users to seamlessly import data from an internal data source called "Data Lab" 
                                    directly into a Google Sheet.

                                    <br /><br />

                                    Within a small, agile-oriented team, we undertook the development of this project using Google Apps Script. 
                                    Our approach involved retrieving data from Data Lab by executing API calls tailored to the user's data request. 
                                    For the user interface, we leveraged Google's Card Service.

                                    <br /><br />

                                    Upon accessing the Workspace add-on, users were presented with the option to choose their desired data set 
                                    for import into their Google Sheet. Once a data set was selected, users had the flexibility to refine the results 
                                    through a series of parameter-based filters or even remove specific columns before importing the table into their 
                                    Google Sheet. This streamlined process allowed users to precisely determine the location within their Google 
                                    Sheet where they wanted their imported data to reside.

                                <p>
                                    During this placement, I had the privilege of working as part of a dynamic team that harnessed the power 
                                    of process mining and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to streamline various financial tasks for our client.

                                    <br /><br />

                                    Process mining involved the meticulous analysis of event logs to construct informative dashboards and visual process flows. 
                                    These tools (UiPath, & Celonis) enabled us to collaborate closely with process owners, dissect the data, and pinpoint 
                                    inefficiencies within the project's workflows. By doing so, we could identify bottlenecks and discern the optimal or 
                                    "happy path" for each process. This insightful analysis served as the foundation for identifying areas where automation 
                                    could be strategically applied, ultimately leading to enhanced efficiency and a reduction in deviations from the ideal 
                                    process flow.

                                    <br /><br />

                                    Throughout this project, our team predominantly utilized UiPath to execute process mining and develop RPA solutions. 
                                    Our focus extended to optimizing processes within the Purchase to Pay (P2P), Order to Cash (O2C), and Record to Report 
                                    (R2R) domains. Our goal was to not only identify inefficiencies but also to implement automated solutions that would 
                                    drive greater efficiency and accuracy across these critical financial processes.

                                    I was part of a team responsible for developing a Tech Delivery Workbench (TDW) for a client. 
                                    A TDW is a valuable tool designed to facilitate the management of agile software development projects. 
                                    It seamlessly integrates various servers, including Jira, Azure DevOps, Slack, GitHub, Jenkins, Microsoft 
                                    Project, and more, to create a comprehensive PowerBI dashboard. This dashboard serves as a user-friendly

                        <p>
                            I participated in the Sentinus IT Bursary Scheme, which provided me with an opportunity to collaborate with the PSNI 
                            (Police Service of Northern Ireland) on various projects during the late summer while I was pursuing my A-Levels. 

                            <br /><br />

                            One of the notable projects I was involved in was the development of a prototype facial recognition system using Python. 
                            This system took two images as input and performed facial landmark identification on the individuals depicted. It also 
                            generated a confidence score to determine the likelihood that the person in image 1 matched any individuals in image 2. 
                            Additionally, the system added bounding boxes around all the faces in the images, allowing users to easily identify 
                            the most likely match to the person in image 1.

                            <br /><br />

                            I also contributed to the setup of a secure cloud storage system called "Box" for the PSNI. I created a program that 
                            facilitated user interaction with spreadsheets stored on Box. This program allowed users to upload individual records 
                            or batch files, delete multiple records, and edit existing records.

                            <br /><br />

                            In the final week of my placement, I compiled a comprehensive report that compared various popular handwriting recognition 
                            software options available on the market at the time. This analysis aimed to assist the PSNI in their efforts to digitize 
                            older handwritten case notes effectively.

                            <br /><br />

                            Throughout this four-week placement, I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with a diverse group of individuals within the PSNI and establish connections with personnel at Box. This experience significantly enhanced my teamwork and communication skills.

                            I was an active participant in the Generation Innovation Reimagining Work Experience Program at Catalyst, spanning four days. 
                            During this program, I collaborated with six fellow students, a Catalyst facilitator, and a representative from Allstate, the company paired with our team.

                            Our collective task was to devise a product to address a challenge presented by Allstate: 
                            "How can we enhance transportation to make it smarter, safer, and more beneficial for everyone in Belfast?".

                            Over the first three days, we meticulously navigated through the various stages of product design. 
                            On the fourth day, we journeyed to the company's location to deliver a presentation of our completed product to twenty senior staff members.
                            Following this presentation, we were tasked with delivering a concise three-minute pitch to an audience of over 250 individuals, 
                            including personnel from diverse companies and academic institutions such as Queens and Ulster. 
                            I had the privilege of being one of the two individuals chosen to deliver this pitch.

                            I participated in the Sentinus Insight Into IT Research Scheme at Ulster University, spanning a week. 
                            Within a team consisting of two other students, our focus was on exploring the outcomes of different scientific experiments by utilizing virtual laboratories to assess their correspondence with real-world counterparts. 
                            After conducting these experiments, we proceeded to compile a comprehensive write-up summarizing our discoveries.

                            I collaborated with a team of three other students to develop a webpage that calculates car insurance premiums based on user-entered parameters. 
                            Our approach involved utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to accomplish this task.
