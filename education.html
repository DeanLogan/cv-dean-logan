                        <h5>1st Class Honours in Software Engineering with Digital Technology Partnership BEng</h5>
                        <p>
                            At Queens I undertook the Software Engineering with Digital Technology Partnership programme, 
                            also known as the Flying Start Degree programme. 
                            
                            <br /><br />
                            
                            This unique academic journey comprises a sequence of placements at PwC, including three summer 
                            placements and two six-month placements. These placements are split between Year 3 
                            and Year 4, with Semester 2 of Year 3 spent at the university and Semester 1 of Year 4 spent at 
                            the university. The remainder of the time is dedicated to my placement at PwC. This unique 
                            structure allows me to gain hands-on experience at PwC while concurrently pursuing my BEng 
                            degree in Software Engineering.

                            <br /><br />

                            For a more in-depth exploration of my experiences during my time at PwC, please refer to the Job History section.
                            
                            <br /><br />


                            Additionally, I am a proud member of the Queen's Computing Society (QCS) and the Google Developer Club. 
                            These extracurricular activities have afforded me the opportunity to delve deeper into various technologies 
                            and gain insights into professionals' experiences in the industry, which often extend beyond the standard 
                            curriculum at Queen's. 
                            
                            <br /><br />

                            Within my time at Queens, I have actively participated in numerous hackathons organized by the school and various 
                            societies. These hackathons have covered a wide array of challenges, ranging from devising solutions for online 
                            learning to enhancing healthcare systems and deciphering ciphers. My involvement in these events has not only 
                            honed my teamwork skills but also enriched my understanding of technology and its real-world applications.

                        <p>
                            During my time at Belfast High I studied both my GCSE's and my A-levels (subjects and grades seen below). <br /><br />
                            While studying for these exams I partook in many extracurricular actives including cross country, badmintion 
                            and the robotics club. In the robotics club we created a robot to compete in the FIRST Tech challange where we 
                            had to create a robot to compete in various challanges against other schools. As part of the robotics team
                            I was primarly in charge of the software engineering aspects, although I was also heavily involed in the other 
                            electronic related aspects as well. <br /><br />
                            I was also the Senior Prefect for Computing and Software Development. One of my responsibilities within this 
                            role was being in charge of the mentoring program within IT where I had to manage the assistent prefects and 
                            mentor my own students. I was also in charge of all the computing related clubs ran in the school, like the 
                            cyber security club where junior students took part in various security related challanges where I was there 
                            to aid them with. This role helped me further develop my leadership skills and improve my ability to simplfy 
                            complex problems.
