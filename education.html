                        <h4>Belfast High School <span class="tl-duration">2013 - 2020</span></h4>
                        <p>
                            During my time at Belfast High I studied both my GCSE's and my A-levels (subjects and grades seen below). <br /><br />
                            While studying for these exams I partook in many extracurricular actives including cross country, badmintion 
                            and the robotics club. In the robotics club we created a robot to compete in the FIRST Tech challange where we 
                            had to create a robot to compete in various challanges against other schools. As part of the robotics team
                            I was primarly in charge of the software engineering aspects, although I was also heavily involed in the other 
                            electronic related aspects as well. <br /><br />
                            I was also the Senior Prefect for Computing and Software Development. One of my responsibilities within this 
                            role was being in charge of the mentoring program within IT where I had to manage the assistent prefects and 
                            mentor my own students. I was also in charge of all the computing related clubs ran in the school, like the 
                            cyber security club where junior students took part in various security related challanges where I was there 
                            to aid them with. This role helped me further develop my leadership skills and improve my ability to simplfy 
                            complex problems.
