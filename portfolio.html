                                    This is my first project using SCSS so I decided to mess around with it and see what different

                                    I created this website back in the summer of 2022 and I have been keeping it up to date with my experiences
                                    ever since. Feel free to share any suggestsions you have for the website!

                                    This is a prototype built as part of CSC3068 Software Development Practice, which constitutes the first half of my final year university project. This prototype serves as a proof of concept for a website designed to assist students in selecting their modules and monitoring their degree progress. It achieves this by providing students with a grade dashboard that displays their assignment and module grades, as well as their overall degree grade, making it easy to determine if they are on track for a 2:1 or a 1st class degree. Additionally, users can access a list of all available modules, which they can filter and search through to identify the best modules for their needs. Students who require further guidance can utilize the Pathfinder chatbot, which assists them in the module selection process. Accessibility options have also been implemented to ensure that students with disabilities can easily navigate the website. <br /><br />
                                    This was achieved through the use of Python 3.7.9, Django 3.2, ChatterBot 1.0.8, HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The project utilizes an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to access the MySQL database, which stores all data, including encrypted user account passwords. Furthermore, a Dockerfile has been included in the project to facilitate ease of deployment.<br /><br />
                                    The files located within the "reports" folder encompass the write-ups, including design documentation, testing reports, and requirements, that were created as part of this module.

The code showcases machine learning techniques, specifically using TensorFlow, to make various neural networks and explore methods such as natural language processing and reinforcement learning. <br /><br />

                                    The course is structured into several modules, covering fundamental machine learning concepts, including core learning algorithms, neural networks (comprising activation functions, optimizers, and model creation), convolutional neural networks, and natural language processing using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Additionally, the course delves into reinforcement learning with Q-learning. <br /><br />

                                    Some projects that I needed to create to earn the certificate include Rock Paper Scissors AI, Cat and Dog Image Classifier, Book Recommendation Engine using KNN, Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator, and Neural Network SMS Text Classifier.

                                    My Computer Science A-Level coursework was created using Python and SQL and the goal was to create a relational database management 
                                    system for a dentistry. <br /><br />
                                    I designed the system with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and ensured that each table had CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
                                    functionality, as well as a robust search feature enabling users to query any field within the tables. Furthermore, I implemented encryption and
                                    decryption mechanisms to secure all data within the system. The system also featured a login system with varying access levels for different 
                                    users. <br /><br />
                                    In addition, I incorporated several advanced features, including the ability to create database backups, generate financial reports that 
                                    provided graphical insights into the profits of the dental practice over the past year based on the database's information, and the option to 
                                    save these reports as Word documents. Moreover, the system allowed for seamless email communication with the staff members listed in the 
                                    database. <br /><br />
                                    All of this was done through the use of various Python libraries.

                                    The Technopoly project was the year long group Coursework  project for the Software Engineering and Systems Development module. <br /><br />
                                    The breif for this project was to create a monopoly like game within Java which is to be navigated through menus in a CLI. This involved,
                                    creating a design document for the game for the first semester including use case diagrams and descriptions, gantt chart of the development 
                                    timeline, a class diagram, use case realisations and a boad layout.  <br /><br />
                                    In the second semester we then developed the code for the game and created a second report documenting any revisions made, test plan, finalized
                                    board layout, and any JUnit test runs which where taken in addition to the testing done in the test plan. <br /><br />
                                    The game itself was (as mentioned before) a monopoly like game where instead of people competing to buy property to gain the most money, it was
                                    users competing to use up as much storage space as they can on a hard drive by downloading files. However it isn't just the names that have 
                                    changed compared to orignal monoply, the Technopoly game also includes mini games like wordle, hangman, tic tac toe and much more.

                                    During this project we created a basic system that would manage student and academic staff member information by using Web APIs.
                                    The first part was to follow the specification and identify the different services to be created by using the Service Identification
                                    algorithm. Once this was done we then developed the SOAP Web APIs in Java and deployed them on a Tomcat Server, then we used 
                                    JAXB Serialization to create clients for the services that we created.

                                    This project involved creating a simple CLI to simulate a prototype of a Jukebox. It was to be done in Java using OOP, with a specific
                                    set of features to be added which involved String, ArrayList and Array manipulation, it also involved reading and writing data to a

                                    This project only lasted 2 weeks.

                                <p>
                                    This is the code that was created during the Liberty IT work experience programme that I took part in during my A-Levels in December 2018. There was a template provided to us which we used to create a website that calculates car insurance premiums based on the information provided by the user.
