                                    This is my first project using SCSS so I decided to mess around with it and see what different 
                                    things I can create from different websites which I liked just to experiement.

                                    This was the coursework project for the Web Technologies module in stage 1 of my Software Engineering degree at Queens. <br /><br />
                                    I worked in a team with four other people where we were tasked to create an escape room game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br /><br />

                                    My Computer Science A-Level coursework was created using Python and SQL and the goal was to create a relational database management 
                                    system for a dentistry. <br /><br />
                                    To achieve this goal I researched common aspects of already existing dentistry databases to try and include all of the necassray tables 
                                    which is needed for such a system. <br /><br />
                                    I then created the system as a GUI and made sure each table had CRUD functionality and a search feature which allowed you to search
                                    any field within the table. It also encrypted and decrypted all of the data in the tables and had a login feature which has different 
                                    access levels depending on the potential user. You can also create a backup of the database, a auto-generated financial report which 
                                    would return a graph of the profits within the last year based on the information within the database, this report could then be saved 
                                    as a word document. You can also send emails to the people in the Staff table. <br /><br />
                                    All of this was done through the use of various Python libraries.

                                    This project involved creating a simple CLI to simulate a prototype of a Jukebox. It was to be done in Java using OOP, with a specific
                                    set of features to be added which involved String, ArrayList and Array manipulation, it also involved reading and writing data to a 
                                    CSV file and we had to complete a testing document as well. <br /><br />
                                    This project only lasted 2 weeks.

                                    The Technopoly project was the year long group Coursework  project for the Software Engineering and Systems Development module. <br /><br />
                                    The breif for this project was to create a monopoly like game within Java which is to be navigated through menus in a CLI. This involved,
                                    creating a design document for the game for the first semester including use case diagrams and descriptions, gantt chart of the development 
                                    timeline, a class diagram, use case realisations and a boad layout.  <br /><br />
                                    In the second semester we then developed the code for the game and created a second report documenting any revisions made, test plan, finalized
                                    board layout, and any JUnit test runs which where taken in addition to the testing done in the test plan. <br /><br />
                                    The game itself was (as mentioned before) a monopoly like game where instead of people competing to buy property to gain the most money, it was
                                    users competing to use up as much storage space as they can on a hard drive by downloading files. However it isn't just the names that have 
                                    changed compared to orignal monoply, the Technopoly game also includes mini games like wordle, hangman, tic tac toe and much more.

                                    During this project we created a basic system that would manage student and academic staff member information by using Web APIs.
                                    The first part was to follow the specification and identify the different services to be created by using the Service Identification
                                    algorithm. Once this was done we then developed the SOAP Web APIs in Java and deployed them on a Tomcat Server, then we used 
                                    JAXB Serialization to create clients for the services that we created.
